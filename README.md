Interpretable Lung Cancer Prediction using Swish-optimized NN 🫁
Official implementation of the research paper: "An Interpretable Deep Learning Framework for Lung Cancer Prediction using Swish-optimized Neural Networks and SHAP Explanations".

📑 Status
Status: Submitted to IEEE for publication.
Methodology: Leverages Swish activation functions and SHAP for reliable medical diagnostics.
🚀 Project Highlights
Swish Optimization: Utilizes the Swish activation function for better gradient flow and higher accuracy in lung cancer detection.
Explainability (XAI): Uses SHAP KernelExplainer to visualize how each clinical symptom (like fatigue, coughing, etc.) impacts the model's prediction.
Robustness: Implemented EarlyStopping and Learning Rate Reduction to prevent overfitting.
📊 Methodology
Data Augmentation: SMOTE was used to handle class imbalance.
Model: A multi-layered Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN).
Interpretability: Local Waterfall plots and Global Summary plots to explain individual patient cases.
🛠 Installation
pip install tensorflow shap pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
